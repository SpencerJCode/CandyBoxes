# CandyBoxes
Submission to an online Algo challenge.

Prompt that reads along the lines of "Suppose you have a line of boxes and a bowl of candy. Write a script that moves down the line of boxes and drops a piece of candy in each box until you get to the end, that then turns around and moves back, repeating until you are out of candy. Include a script that identifies which box received the final piece of candy."
